What is it?
===========

JsDataFlowEditor is a graph editing widget based on Raphael.  It's optimally
suited for building and manipulating dataflows, e.g. compositing chains, audio
synthesis, graphics production, etc.  The look and feel is largely inspired by
Blender and Quartz Composer.

This fork was developed by Ryan Moore simply to bring this library up to date
with the latest versions of jQuery and Raphael. Some of the documentation here
describes plans that never came to fruition (e.g., ``That API will be changing
shortly.''). I have left the original documentation mostly in tact. As of this
writing, the original version hadn't been modified in about 3 years. Some
glitches remain, particularly after moving around nodes.

Have any examples?

  -- Work in progress audio synthesizer

How do you use it?
==================

Pull in Raphael 2.1.0, jQuery 1.9.1, and jsdatafloweditor.js. See
Examples/Alyn/index.html for an example of how to do that. This branch
automatically contains a relatively recent version of Raphael (as of the time
of this writing) and pulls in jQuery 1.9.1 from the jQuery CDN.

Create a graphEditor object, create graphNodes and add points to them, and
optionally connect them automatically.  You can also attach to various events
on the nodes, e.g. when another node is connected/disconnected.

Documentation
=============

`new graphEditor(element_id, width, height[, theme])`.  Parameters:

- `element_id` -- ID to the graph container in the DOM.  This can be a table
  cell, div, etc. Example: "audio-graph" (not "#audio-graph").
- `width` and `height` -- Dimensions of the graph editor.
- `theme` -- Optional.  Hash containing the following keys (use as many or as
  few as you wish to customize):
	- nodeFill -- Background color for graph nodes
	- pointInactive -- Connection point fill color when not connected
	- pointActive -- Connection point fill color when connected
	- connectingFill -- Fill for the line while connecting
	- connectingStroke -- Stroke for the line while connecting
	- connectingStrokeWidth -- Width of the line while connecting
	- lineFill -- Fill for the line when connected
	- lineStroke -- Stroke for the line when connected
	- lineStrokeWidth -- Width of the line when connected

`graphEditor.addNode(x, y, node)`.  Parameters:

- `x` and `y` -- Coordinates for the upper-left corner of the node to add.
- `node` -- `graphNode` object.

`new graphNode(id, title)`. Parameters:

- `id` -- ID for this graph node.  At the moment, this is simply stored as
  `.id` on the node and not used.
- `title` -- Title as shown on the node.

`graphNode` contains the following events, which can be registered to via
`nodeObject.eventType.add(yourFunction)` or triggered via
`nodeObject.eventType(params...)`:

- `focus()` -- Node has focus
- `blur()` -- Node has lost focus
- `connect(thisPoint, otherPoint)` -- Connected to another node.  Parameters
  are `point` objects.
- `disconnect()` -- Disconnected from another node.  Parameters are `point`
  objects.
- `update()` -- Data in the node has been updated.  Must be called by you if
  you need data updating support.
- `remove()` -- Node has been removed.  Can be called by you to delete the
  node.

`graphNode.addPoint(label, dir[, multi])`.  Parameters:

- `label` -- Label for the connection point.
- `dir` -- Direction of the connection point, `'in'` or `'out'`.
- `multi` -- Optional.  Boolean to determine whether it can be connected to
  multiple other points.  This defaults to `false` for inputs (meaning inputs
by default can only be connected to one element) and `true` for outputs.

`point` object properties:

- `label` -- Label for this connection point.
- `connection` -- Array of connections to other nodes.

Connecting points automatically is messy at this point, but can be done using
the `point.connect` method.  Consult the source if you want to go down that
rabbit hole.  That API will be changing shortly.

Known/future issues
===================

- Connecting points can sometimes be difficult due to the precision necessary
  to select the proper Raphael element.
- In some Chrome builds, dragging nodes around seems to glitch out badly.
- The API for connecting points programatically is a mess.
- Themability is limited to colors right now, really, rather than being able to
  drastically change the look and feel.
- It'd be nice to be able to put values on the nodes themselves, much like
  Blender's compositor.
